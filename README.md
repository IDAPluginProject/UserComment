# UserComment

[简体中文](./README_zh_CN.md)

An IDA plugin to display user-added comments in disassembly and pseudocode views.

## Note

This plugin is implemented based on hooking, meaning it can only capture and save the user-added comments after the plugin is installed.

<b>Any user comments added prior to the installation of the plugin will not be captured.</b>

## Installation

Copy the `UserComment.py` file to the `plugins` folder in the IDA installation directory.

## Usage

There are three ways to open the comment window:
1. Choose 'View/Open subviews/Comments' from the menu
2. Use the shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-C)
3. Press `Ctrl-!`, then choose "Comments"

## Features

- Provides a comment window, displaying user-added comments, including comments in assembly code and pseudocode.
- Support for different types of comments (common comments, repeatable comments, anterior comments, and posterior comments).
- Captured user-added comments will be preserved in the IDB.
- Double-click on a comment entry to quickly navigate to the corresponding location.
- Use IDA's built-in chooser, providing a handy filter functionality.
